3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the API key

### 2. Set Environment Variable

**Option A: Persistent (Recommended)**

setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your-api-key-here"
```
Then **close and reopen** your terminal for the change to take effect.

**Option B: Temporary (Current Session Only)**
```cmd

### Commands

- `/exit` or `/quit` - Exit the chat
- `/clear` - Clear conversation history
- `/save` - Save conversation to a text file
- `/file <path>` - Analyze a file from your project
- `/help` - Show help message

## Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Ask detailed questions about your code
2. **Share Context**: Mention the VIB3 project and Flutter when relevant
3. **Use /file**: Analyze specific files for targeted advice
4. **Save Important Chats**: Use `/save` to keep useful conversations

## Troubleshooting

### "GEMINI_API_KEY not set" error

2. **Reopened your terminal** after using `setx`
3. Used the correct command for your shell (CMD vs PowerShell)
