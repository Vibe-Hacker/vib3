# Claude + Grok Integrated Workflow

## How I (Claude) Use Grok Automatically:

### 1. **When You Request a Feature**
- I analyze the request
- I ask Grok to plan the implementation
- I ask Grok to generate the code
- I integrate it into your codebase
- I test and debug with Grok's help
- I commit and push the working feature

### 2. **When We Hit an Error**
- I capture the error details
- I send it to Grok for analysis
- I apply Grok's fix
- I verify it works
- I document the solution

### 3. **When Optimizing Code**
- I identify performance bottlenecks
- I ask Grok for optimization strategies
- I implement the improvements
- I measure the results

## Example Workflow:

**You say:** "Add a trending hashtags feature"

**I automatically:**
1. Use Grok to plan: `plan-feature "trending hashtags" "show popular hashtags, track usage"`
2. Use Grok to generate code: `generate-code "trending hashtags API" "MongoDB aggregation for hashtag counts"`
3. Use Grok for UI: `generate-code "trending hashtags UI" "Flutter widget to display trending tags"`
4. Integrate all pieces
5. Test the feature
6. Commit and deploy

## Current Integration Status:
✅ Grok bridge created and working
✅ I can call Grok programmatically
✅ API key secured in environment

## What This Means:
- You don't need to manage Grok directly
- Just tell me what you want built
- I'll use Grok strategically to accelerate development
- You get faster, better code with AI assistance

## Benefits:
1. **Faster Development** - Grok generates boilerplate code instantly
2. **Better Architecture** - Grok suggests optimal patterns
3. **Fewer Bugs** - Grok reviews code before deployment
4. **Consistent Quality** - Grok ensures best practices

You can just say things like:
- "Add video reactions feature"
- "Make the app faster"
- "Fix the bug with comments"
- "Add Instagram-style stories"

And I'll automatically use Grok where it helps!
