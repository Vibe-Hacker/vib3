# GPT-5 Helper for VIB3 Development

## Setup Complete! âœ…

The GPT-5 command-line helper is now installed and ready to use.

## TWO WAYS TO USE

### Method 1: INTERACTIVE CHAT MODE (Recommended - Talk Naturally!)

Just double-click the **"VIB3 GPT-5 Helper"** shortcut on your Desktop!

Then type your questions normally - just like talking to a person:

```
You: how do I add stories to VIB3
You: explain the video feed code
You: help me fix this error
```

**Commands:**
- Type `exit` or `quit` to end the chat
- Type `clear` to start a fresh conversation

### Method 2: SINGLE QUESTION MODE

For quick one-off questions:

```cmd
cd C:\Users\VIBE\Desktop\VIB3\vib3_app

python gpt_helper.py "your question about VIB3"
```

## Example Commands

### General Flutter Questions
```cmd
python gpt_helper.py "How do I add a chat feature to my Flutter app?"
python gpt_helper.py "What's the best way to handle video playback in Flutter?"
python gpt_helper.py "How do I optimize Flutter app performance?"
```

### VIB3-Specific Questions
```cmd
python gpt_helper.py "Help me add a stories feature like Instagram"
python gpt_helper.py "How do I implement live streaming in the VIB3 app?"
python gpt_helper.py "What's the best way to handle video uploads to DigitalOcean?"
```

### Code Review
```cmd
python gpt_helper.py "Review my video_service.dart implementation"
python gpt_helper.py "Is my API service following best practices?"
```

### Debugging
```cmd
python gpt_helper.py "Why might my videos not show mirrored in the feed?"
