You: How do I fix the front-facing camera issue in my Flutter app?

GPT-5: [GPT-5's response here]

You: What about camera permissions?

GPT-5: [GPT-5's response here]

You: exit

Goodbye!
```

## Key Differences from Complex Version

| Feature | Complex Version | Simple Version |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Tool calling | Yes (7 tools) | No |
| Autonomous actions | Yes | No |
| Response parsing | Complex | Simple (just `output_text`) |
| Conversation style | Task-oriented | Chat-oriented |
| Complexity | High | Minimal |

## Now You Can Ask GPT-5 About the Camera Issue

You mentioned wanting GPT-5's help with the front-facing camera problem that's been frustrating you. This simple interface is ready for you to:

1. Describe the camera issue
2. Share error messages
3. Ask for debugging suggestions
4. Get fresh perspective on the problem

## Technical Details

- Uses OpenAI Responses API (`client.responses.create()`)
- Model: `gpt-5` (auto-selects latest variant)
- API key: Reads from `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Knowledge cutoff: October 2024 (this is normal for GPT-5)

## If You Get Errors

**Error: "No module named 'openai'"**
