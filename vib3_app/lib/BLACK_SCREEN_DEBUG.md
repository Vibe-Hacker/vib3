# Black Screen Debug - Changes Made

## Issue
Videos showing black screens with logs indicating:
- `_isInitialized=false, _controller=false, isPlaying=true`
- Video widgets created but not initializing

## Debug Changes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging
Added extensive logging to track:
- InitState conditions and execution
- didUpdateWidget play state changes  
- Post frame callback execution
- Queue processing status

### 2. Removed Queue Dependency (Testing)
- **File**: `lib/widgets/video_player_widget.dart`
- **Change**: Bypassed VideoPlayerManager queue temporarily
- **Reason**: Test if queue processing is causing initialization delays

### 3. Direct Initialization Call
- Changed from post-frame callback to direct initialization
- Removed error condition check for initialization on play state change

## Expected Results
With these changes:
1. Videos should initialize immediately when `isPlaying=true`
2. Debug logs should show the initialization process
3. If successful, indicates queue was causing delays

## Next Steps
1. Test with current changes
2. If successful, optimize queue system
3. If still failing, check controller creation and network issues

## Key Log Messages to Watch For
- `ðŸŽ† About to initialize video directly (bypassing queue)...`
- `ðŸŽ® _initializeVideo called for [URL]`
- `âœ… VideoPlayer: Successfully initialized [URL]`

## Rollback Plan
If this causes issues, restore the queue system by:
1. Reverting the queue bypass changes
2. Investigating queue processing delays
3. Adding queue priority for currently playing videos
