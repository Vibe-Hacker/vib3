# Video Editor Overflow Fixes Summary

## Problem
The edit mode buttons at the bottom of the video edit screen were causing overflow errors when displayed.

## Root Cause
The modules (Music, Text, Effects, Filters, Tools) were being displayed in a `Positioned` widget with constrained height (between top toolbar at 56px and bottom toolbar at 80px). These modules were using `Column` widgets with nested `Expanded` widgets, which don't work well in constrained containers.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Main Module Layout Fixes
- **music_module.dart**: 
  - Removed SafeArea wrapper that was adding extra padding
  - Changed main TabBarView from `Expanded` to `Flexible`
  - Changed nested music list from `Expanded` to `Flexible`
  - Changed sound effects grid from `Expanded` to `Flexible`

- **text_module.dart**:
  - Changed main TabBarView from `Expanded` to `Flexible`
  - Changed text styling controls from `Expanded` to `Flexible`
  - Changed sticker grid from `Expanded` to `Flexible`

- **effects_module.dart**:
  - Changed main TabBarView from `Expanded` to `Flexible`

- **filters_module.dart**:
  - Changed main TabBarView from `Expanded` to `Flexible`
  - Changed filter options from `Expanded` to `Flexible`
  - Changed filter item containers from `Expanded` to `Flexible`

- **tools_module.dart**:
  - Changed main TabBarView from `Expanded` to `Flexible`

### 2. Video Creator Screen
- Wrapped each module in a Container with black background to ensure proper rendering

## Key Technical Changes
- Replaced `Expanded` widgets with `Flexible` widgets in constrained layouts
- `Flexible` allows widgets to take up available space without forcing expansion
- This prevents overflow errors when parent containers have fixed constraints

## Testing Notes
The modules should now properly display within the constrained space between the top and bottom toolbars without causing overflow errors.
