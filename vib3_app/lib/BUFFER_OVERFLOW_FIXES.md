# Buffer Overflow Fixes

## Issue Resolved
The `ImageReader_JNI: Unable to acquire a buffer item` warnings were caused by:
- Too many video controllers trying to acquire image buffers simultaneously
- Insufficient buffer cleanup when controllers are disposed
- No limit on concurrent video decoders

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Video Player Options
- **File**: `lib/services/video_performance_service.dart`
- **Added**: Android-specific options to reduce texture usage
- **Setting**: `useTextureProxyForce: false` to minimize buffer allocation

### 2. Buffer Management Service (NEW)
- **File**: `lib/services/buffer_management_service.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Limits concurrent video controllers to 3 maximum
  - Automatic cleanup of inactive controllers
  - Emergency cleanup for memory pressure
  - Periodic buffer maintenance (every 10 seconds)
  - FIFO disposal of oldest non-playing controllers

### 3. Improved Controller Disposal
- **File**: `lib/widgets/video_player_widget.dart`
- **Enhanced**: `_disposeController()` method
- **Added**: 
  - Buffer clearing with `seekTo(Duration.zero)`
  - Proper unregistration from both managers
  - Delayed disposal for texture cleanup

### 4. Better Initialization Control
- **File**: `lib/widgets/video_player_widget.dart`
- **Added**: Immediate pause for non-playing videos after initialization
- **Prevents**: Unnecessary buffer allocation for preloaded videos

### 5. Service Integration
- **File**: `lib/main.dart`
- **Added**: BufferManagementService initialization at app startup
- **Ensures**: Buffer limits are enforced from app launch

## Technical Details

### Buffer Limits
- **Max Controllers**: 3 simultaneous video players
- **Cleanup Interval**: Every 10 seconds
- **Emergency Cleanup**: Available for memory pressure situations

### Disposal Strategy
1. Pause video playback
2. Seek to beginning (clears decode buffer)
3. Unregister from all managers
4. Dispose controller with delay for texture cleanup

### Automatic Management
- Non-playing controllers are automatically paused and buffer-cleared
- Disposed/errored controllers are removed from tracking
- Oldest controllers are disposed first when limit is exceeded

## Expected Results
- Elimination of `ImageReader_JNI` buffer warnings
- Better memory management for video playback
- Smoother scrolling through video feeds
- Reduced crashes from memory pressure

## Monitoring
Buffer status can be checked via `BufferManagementService().getBufferStatus()` which returns:
- Total active controllers
- Playing/buffering/initialized counts  
- Error status
- Current vs maximum allowed
