# Compilation Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Enum and Class Declaration Error**
   - **Problem**: Enums and classes can't be declared inside other classes in Dart
   - **Fix**: Moved `VideoQuality` enum and `VideoPerformanceMetrics` class to top-level
   - **Files**: `lib/services/video_performance_service.dart`

2. **Duplicate dispose() Method**
   - **Problem**: Two dispose methods in VideoPlayerWidget
   - **Fix**: Merged functionality into single dispose method
   - **Files**: `lib/widgets/video_player_widget.dart`

3. **Type Reference Errors**
   - **Problem**: `VideoPerformanceService.VideoQuality` syntax errors
   - **Fix**: Changed to just `VideoQuality` after moving enum to top-level
   - **Files**: `lib/providers/video_provider.dart`

4. **Missing Video State Listener**
   - **Problem**: Reference to undefined `_videoStateListener`
   - **Fix**: Removed the reference as it wasn't needed
   - **Files**: `lib/widgets/video_player_widget.dart`

## Files Modified:

1. `/lib/services/video_performance_service.dart` - Moved enum and class to top-level
2. `/lib/providers/video_provider.dart` - Fixed type references  
3. `/lib/widgets/video_player_widget.dart` - Fixed duplicate dispose method

The app should now compile successfully with all video performance optimizations intact.
