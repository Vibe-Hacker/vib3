## What's Different from Autonomous?

**Autonomous version** (gpt5_autonomous.py):
- System prompt says "Execute actions IMMEDIATELY without asking"
- Very task-focused and robotic
- Just does things and reports results

**Assistant version** (gpt5_assistant.py):
- System prompt says "Be friendly, conversational, and helpful"
- Works like Claude Code - talks to you
- Explains what it's doing and shows you results
- Asks questions when needed

## Now You Can Get Help!

You can ask GPT-5:
- "Can you see my vib3 project?"
