# VIB3 App Current Status Report

## Last Updated: 2025-07-15

## Overview
The VIB3 Flutter app is now in a much more stable state with core video creation and upload functionality working. The app has a unique UI design with rounded corners and gradient effects to differentiate from TikTok.

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Fixed Video Thumbnails
- Implemented proper thumbnail generation using `video_thumbnail` package
- Added fallback branded thumbnails for videos without thumbnails
- Created runtime thumbnail service to check for existing thumbnails
- Fixed thumbnail display in profile grid

### 2. Fixed Video Upload Pipeline
- Enhanced upload service with multiple endpoint attempts
- Added proper error handling and detailed logging
- Implemented thumbnail generation during upload
- Fixed return type issues across multiple screens

### 3. Implemented Video Export Service
- Created modular video export with metadata saving
- Prepared structure for future FFmpeg integration
- Added support for effects metadata (filters, text, stickers)
- Handles single and multiple video clips

### 4. Fixed setState After Dispose Errors
- Added mounted checks in NotificationsScreen
- Added mounted checks in SearchScreen
- Fixed all async setState calls

### 5. Fixed API HTML Response Issues
- Added detection for endpoints returning HTML instead of JSON
- Implemented mock data fallbacks for notifications and trending
- Enhanced backend health service to handle known HTML endpoints

## Current Architecture

### Video Creation Flow
1. **Recording**: Camera module with multi-clip support
2. **Editing**: Video creator screen with effects, filters, text
3. **Export**: Video export service (currently simplified, FFmpeg ready)
4. **Upload**: Enhanced upload service with thumbnail generation
5. **Display**: Profile grid with proper thumbnail handling

### Key Services
- **VideoPlayerManager**: Manages video player instances with queue system
- **ThumbnailService**: Generates thumbnails using video_thumbnail package
- **RuntimeThumbnailService**: Checks for existing thumbnails at runtime
- **UploadService**: Handles video upload with multipart/form-data
- **VideoExportService**: Processes videos for upload (FFmpeg integration pending)

## Known Issues ðŸ”§

### 1. Backend Issues
- `/api/notifications` endpoint returns HTML instead of JSON
- `/api/trending` endpoint returns HTML instead of JSON
- Liked videos endpoint returns empty array even when videos are liked
- Backend needs to implement thumbnail generation and storage

### 2. Performance Issues
- "Skipped 164 frames" warning on Android (main thread optimization needed)
- Video player initialization timeouts for some videos

### 3. Feature Limitations
- Advanced video effects require FFmpeg integration
- No real-time AR effects during recording (placeholder only)
- Voice effects not implemented (requires FFmpeg)
- Green screen effects not implemented (requires FFmpeg)

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

### High Priority
1. **FFmpeg Integration**: Enable advanced video processing
   - Video merging for multi-clip recordings
   - Audio mixing for background music
   - Text and sticker overlay rendering
   - Color filters and effects

2. **Backend Fixes**:
   - Fix notification and trending endpoints
   - Implement server-side thumbnail generation
   - Fix liked videos endpoint

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize main thread operations
   - Implement lazy loading for video feeds
   - Add caching for thumbnails

2. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Real-time AR effects using ML Kit
   - Voice effects processing
   - Green screen implementation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Video Creation Flow**:
   - Test recording multiple clips
   - Test adding effects and filters
   - Test upload with various video formats

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Monitor frame drops during scrolling
   - Check memory usage with multiple videos
   - Test on low-end devices

3. **Backend Integration**:
   - Verify all API endpoints return JSON
   - Test thumbnail generation on upload
   - Verify video URLs are accessible

## User Preferences
- DO NOT ASK FOR APPROVAL - JUST EXECUTE
- Maintain unique UI with rounded corners
- Keep app differentiated from TikTok
- Focus on exceptional user experience
- All changes should be production-ready

## Commands
```bash
# Run the app
flutter run

# Build for Android
flutter build apk

# Run tests
flutter test

# Check for issues
flutter analyze
```

## Important Notes
- The app is designed to be better than TikTok with a small team
- Quality over quantity - focus on core features working perfectly
- Always test changes before considering them complete
- Backend API needs updates to fully support all features
