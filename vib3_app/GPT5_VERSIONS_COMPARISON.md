# GPT-5 Versions - Which One to Use?

You now have THREE versions of GPT-5 for VIB3. Here's how they differ:

## 1. Simple Version (gpt5_simple.py)
**Desktop Shortcut:** "GPT-5 Simple Assistant"

### What It Does
- Pure chat interface like ChatGPT
- No tools, no file access
- Just conversation

### When to Use
- Quick questions about Flutter/Dart
- Get explanations or suggestions
- Don't need it to actually do anything

### Example
```
You: How do I fix a camera initialization error?
GPT-5: You should check the camera permissions in AndroidManifest.xml...
You: Thanks!
```

**Pros:** Fast, simple, just answers questions
**Cons:** Can't see your code, can't make changes

---

## 2. Assistant Version (gpt5_assistant.py)
**Desktop Shortcut:** "GPT-5 Assistant"

### What It Does
- Conversational like Claude Code
- Full project access (read/write files, run commands)
- Interactive - you guide it

### When to Use
- You want to explore your code with GPT-5
- You want help but want to stay in control
- You want to review changes before applying them
- You want to chat while it works

### Example
```
You: Can you see my vib3 project?
GPT-5: Yes! Let me check what's there... [uses list_dir]
GPT-5: I can see lib/, android/, pubspec.yaml. What do you need?

You: What's in the camera screen?
GPT-5: Let me read it... [uses read_file]
GPT-5: The EnhancedCameraScreen uses camera package...

You: Can you fix the front camera issue?
GPT-5: Sure! First tell me what's happening with the front camera?

You: It doesn't initialize properly
GPT-5: Let me search for camera initialization... [uses search_files]
GPT-5: I found the issue! Want me to fix it?

You: Yes
GPT-5: Done! [uses write_file]
```

**Pros:** Interactive, conversational, you stay in control
**Cons:** Requires your input at each step

## 3. Master Coder / Autocoder (vib3_autocoder.py) ⭐ NEW!
**Desktop Shortcut:** "VIB3 Autocoder"
**Based on:** GPT-5's official "Master Coder" instructions

### What It Does
- **Fully autonomous** - you give it a goal and it runs until done
- Plan → Execute → Observe → Critic loop
- Maintains task queue, keeps drilling down
- Auto-backup, auto-commit to git
- Full safety guards and logging

### When to Use
- You have a specific goal/task to accomplish
- You want GPT-5 to work autonomously
- You want it to keep iterating until done
- You trust it to make changes (all backed up!)

### Example
```
You: [Run VIB3 Autocoder]
You: "Fix the front-facing camera issue"

GPT-5: PLAN: Search for camera files, analyze initialization
      [searches files, finds camera code]

GPT-5: OBSERVATION: Found EnhancedCameraScreen
      [reads file]

GPT-5: OBSERVATION: Camera controller missing lens direction check
      PLAN: Fix initialization logic

GPT-5: ACTION: Writing fix to enhanced_camera_screen.dart
      [writes file, backs up, commits to git]

GPT-5: ACTION: Running flutter analyze
      [runs command]

GPT-5: OBSERVATION: Analysis passed

GPT-5: ACTION: Building APK
      [builds]

GPT-5: OBSERVATION: Build succeeded

GPT-5: PLAN: Task complete! Front camera fix applied and tested.
```

**Pros:** Autonomous, keeps going until done, full logging/backup
**Cons:** Less interactive, runs on its own

## Which One Should You Use?

### For the Camera Issue

**Simple Version:**
- Can suggest what to try
- Can't see your actual code
- Can't make the fix

**Assistant Version:**
- Can read your camera code
- Can make the fix interactively
- You guide the process step by step

**Autocoder (Best!):**
- Can autonomously find the problem
- Can implement the fix
- Can test and iterate
- Keeps going until it works!

### Recommendation

**For your camera issue:** Use **VIB3 Autocoder**!

```cmd
python vib3_autocoder.py "Fix the front-facing camera initialization issue"
```

It will:
1. Search for camera-related files
2. Read and analyze the code
3. Identify the problem
4. Implement a fix
5. Test the fix with flutter analyze and build
6. Iterate if needed
7. Stop when done

All changes backed up to `.vib3_backups/` and committed to branch `autocoder/vib3`!

## How to Run Them

### Simple
Double-click **"GPT-5 Simple Assistant"**

### Assistant
Double-click **"GPT-5 Assistant"**

### Autocoder (Setup Required)
1. Run **`VIB3_Autocoder_Setup.bat`** ONCE
2. Open a NEW command prompt
3. Double-click **"VIB3 Autocoder"**
4. Enter your goal

---

## They All Use GPT-5!

All three versions use the same GPT-5 model:
- Model: `gpt-5` (latest variant)
- Knowledge cutoff: October 2024
- Current date: October 25, 2025

The difference is just HOW they work:
- **Simple**: Chat only
- **Assistant**: Interactive with tools
- **Autocoder**: Autonomous with tools + agent loop

---

## TL;DR

**Quick Question?** → Use **Simple**
**Want to Explore Code?** → Use **Assistant**
**Need Something Fixed?** → Use **Autocoder** ⭐

For your front-facing camera issue that's been frustrating you for a week, the **Autocoder** is your best bet. It's GPT-5's official autonomous agent pattern, and it won't give up until the task is done!
