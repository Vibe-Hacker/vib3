# Legacy Directory Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-07-21

### Directories Removed
1. **www/** - Legacy web interface directory
2. **web/** - Duplicate web directory
3. **app/** - Legacy app directory with Firebase configuration
4. **mobile/** - Legacy mobile-specific web directory

### Server.js Modifications
1. Commented out static file serving for `/app` route
2. Commented out static file serving for `/mobile` route
3. Removed all static file serving from www directory
4. Updated root route (`/`) to return JSON message instead of serving HTML
5. Commented out mobile device detection and redirect logic

### Files Preserved
- Documentation files (*.md) were backed up to `/legacy-backup/docs/`
- All other unique code was already duplicated in the Flutter app

### Current State
- Server now only provides API endpoints for the Flutter app
- No web interface is served
- All requests to `/` return a JSON message directing users to use the Flutter app
- API endpoints remain fully functional at `/api/*`

### Benefits
1. Cleaner project structure
2. Reduced confusion about which code is active
3. Single source of truth (Flutter app)
4. Smaller deployment size
5. Easier maintenance

### Next Steps
- Ensure all deployment scripts are updated to not reference these directories
- Update any documentation that mentions the web interface
- Consider removing the backup directory after confirming everything works
