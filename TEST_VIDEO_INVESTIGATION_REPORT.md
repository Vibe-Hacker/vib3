# VIB3 Test Video Investigation Report

## Issue Identified
The test videos appearing in production were being **generated on-the-fly** by the server, not stored in the database.

## Root Cause
In `server-full.js` (lines 504-556), the `/api/videos` endpoint was:
1. Taking real videos from the database
2. Creating duplicates with generated titles like:
   - "Trending Video #123" (for 'foryou' feed)
   - "Viral Trending #456" (for 'explore' feed)
   - "Update from friend" (for 'following' feed)
3. These duplicates were created for infinite scroll functionality

## Fix Applied
âœ… **FIXED**: Removed the duplicate video generation code
- Videos now display with their original titles from the database
- No more test-like generated titles
- Preserves all original video metadata

## Remaining Issues

### 1. 403 Forbidden Errors
These are likely caused by videos in the database with invalid/broken URLs. To fix:

1. **Check your production MongoDB** for videos with bad URLs:
```javascript
// Find videos with potentially broken URLs
db.videos.find({
  $or: [
    { videoUrl: /sample|test|demo|example\.com|placeholder/i },
    { videoUrl: { $exists: false } },
    { videoUrl: null },
    { videoUrl: "" }
  ]
}).pretty()
```

2. **Delete broken videos** from the database:
```javascript
db.videos.deleteMany({
  $or: [
    { videoUrl: /sample|test|demo|example\.com|placeholder/i },
    { videoUrl: { $exists: false } },
    { videoUrl: null },
    { videoUrl: "" }
  ]
})
```

### 2. Check for Test Data
Run these queries in your production MongoDB:

```javascript
// Count all videos
db.videos.countDocuments()

// Find test users
db.users.find({
  $or: [
    { username: /test|demo|sample/i },
    { email: /test|demo|sample/i }
  ]
}).pretty()

// Show video URL domains
db.videos.aggregate([
  { $match: { videoUrl: { $exists: true, $ne: null, $ne: "" } } },
  { $project: { 
      domain: { 
        $substr: [ "$videoUrl", 0, { $indexOfCP: [ "$videoUrl", "/" , 8 ] } ] 
      } 
    } 
  },
  { $group: { _id: "$domain", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { count: -1 } }
])
```

### 3. Clean Storage (if needed)
If you have orphaned files in DigitalOcean Spaces causing 403 errors:

Use the admin cleanup endpoint (already in your server):
```bash
# Check cleanup status
curl https://your-domain.com/api/admin/cleanup/status

# Clean all videos (BE CAREFUL - this deletes everything!)
curl -X DELETE https://your-domain.com/api/admin/cleanup/videos
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy is already done** - The fix has been pushed to production
2. **Monitor your feeds** - Check if test-like titles are gone
3. **Clean database** - Remove any actual test videos stored in MongoDB
4. **Fix 403 errors** - Delete videos with broken URLs from the database

## Scripts Created
- `inspect-database.js` - Inspect local MongoDB (requires connection)
- `inspect-production-api.js` - Check production API endpoints
- `check-production-videos.js` - MongoDB queries to find test videos
- `fix-video-endpoint.js` - The fix that was applied

The main issue (test-like generated titles) should now be resolved in production!
