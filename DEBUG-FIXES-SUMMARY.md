# VIB3 Debug Fixes Summary

## Issue: "Failed to load video" error on login

### Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced Error Logging in VideoService** (`vib3_app/lib/services/video_service.dart`):
   - Added detailed logging for API calls showing token, feed type, and URL
   - Added response status and headers logging
   - Added error type and stack trace logging
   - Removed fallback to mock videos - now returns empty list on error
   - Added response data keys logging to debug API responses

2. **Enhanced Error Handling in VideoProvider** (`vib3_app/lib/providers/video_provider.dart`):
   - Added stack trace logging to all feed loading methods
   - Clear error state and videos on failure
   - Don't set error state in initializeLikesAndFollows (non-critical)

3. **Added Debug Logging in VideoFeed** (`vib3_app/lib/widgets/video_feed.dart`):
   - Log auth token presence in initState
   - Log feed type and token when visibility changes
   - Added warning when no auth token is available

### Root Causes Identified:

1. **Mock Videos Issue**: When the API fails, the app was returning mock videos with fake URLs that can't actually play, causing "failed to load video" errors
2. **Error State Persistence**: Error state from initialization was affecting video loading
3. **API Connection**: Need to verify backend is properly responding

### To Test:

1. Run the build script: `build-flutter-apk.bat`
2. Install the APK on your device
3. Login and check the console/logcat for debug messages
4. The debug logs will show:
   - Whether auth token is present
   - What API URL is being called
   - Server response status and data
   - Exact error messages and stack traces

### Next Steps:

1. Check if the backend server is running and accessible
2. Verify the API endpoint URLs match between Flutter app and server
3. Check if authentication tokens are being properly passed
4. Review server logs to see if requests are reaching the backend

The app will now show empty feeds instead of mock videos when there's an API error, which is better UX.
